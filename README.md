Vanya is the nickname of [Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Fyodorovich_Karamazov).

`vanya_functools` provides functional programming tools in python which can be achieved, but not necessarily should be achieved.

## Installation

To install `vanya_functools`, use pip:

```sh
pip install vanya_functools
```


## Testing

There are currently no Github actions or tests. I plan to add them shortly so that chaotic behaviour of the modules included are stably rolled out.
